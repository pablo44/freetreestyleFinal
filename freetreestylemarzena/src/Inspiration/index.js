                        <p> My design adventure began together with my family's life.
Â                            I begun thinking about what things we need in our household
                            and suddenly I realized that I can do many tings on my own.
                            I took the first step, I fell in love in woodworking, first
                            I always remember that smell of wood in my ouncle's workshop.
                            First renovation objects were quite simple, decoupage
                            was the important part of the whole introductory process.
